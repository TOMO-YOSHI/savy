Savy is a data driven responsive website that provides a variety of information about Recycling.
(This project is for portfolio and investigation not for release or monetize.)

# Why I (our team) created this web application
I created this web app to show my development skill.
I can create an interactive UI using ReactJS with several technology, such as MaterialUI and Google Maps API.

I am able to handle multiple HTTP requests and display the results because of the well-understanding of the React component lifecycle and the concept of the component tree.

I was responsible for creating [Waste Management Page](https://www.savy-app.ca/waste-management) and cloud server configuration in this project.

## Infrastracture
To deploy the web app, I am using AWS EC2. I have set up Node.js webserver and MySQL database server on it. Moreover, some other networking settings have been done at the same time, such as reverse proxy, firewall and ssl.

## Front-end
In the front-end development, I utilized modern web develpment technology, such as ReactJS, Redux, MaterialUI, SASS and Google Maps API to implement interactive user interface. In addtion, the website adopt responsive responsibe design to fit any sizes of users' device.

This is created by the team Savy.
