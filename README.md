# About
![top_logo](https://tomo-portfolio.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/savy_logo_bg.png)

Savy is a data driven responsive website that provides a variety of information about Recycling.
(This project is for portfolio and investigation not for release or monetize.)

# Why I (our team) created this web application
I created this web app to show my development skill.
I can create an interactive UI using ReactJS with several technology, such as MaterialUI and Google Maps API.

I am able to handle multiple HTTP requests and display the results because of the well-understanding of the React component lifecycle and the concept of the component tree.

I was responsible for creating [Waste Management Page](https://www.savy-app.ca/waste-management) and cloud server configuration in this project.

# System Architecture

## Infrastracture
To deploy the web app, I am using AWS EC2. I have set up Node.js webserver and MySQL database server on it. Moreover, some other networking settings have been done at the same time, such as reverse proxy, firewall and ssl.

## Front-end
In the front-end development, I utilized modern web develpment technology, such as ReactJS, Redux, MaterialUI, SASS and Google Maps API to implement interactive user interface. In addtion, the website adopt responsive responsibe design to fit any sizes of users' device.

### *** Here is the Create React App's default README. ***

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
